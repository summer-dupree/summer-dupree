_Hello, relatives. My name is Summer Dupree. I am of the Plants-by-the-Waters band of Lakota, and I'm from the Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota._


### Educational Background

I'm a fourth-year student at Oglala Lakota College (OLC) working toward a B.S. in Natural Science with an emphasis in Conservation Biology. I also work as a research assistant with OLC building a habitat suitability model for a culturally significant plant on the Cheyenne River Reservation. This is my third year participating in the ESIIL Stars Internship and my second year as an Advanced Intern (A.I.).


### Interests in Earth Data Science (EDS)
I'm interested in analyzing existing data to expand my understanding of the ecosystems present in South Dakota and other historic Oceti Sakowin territory and building my knowledge base in programming and EDS to better serve my community. Specifically, I'm interested in seeing how existing remote sensing data can inform my understanding of the plant communities present on South Dakota reservations.
