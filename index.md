_Hello, my relatives. My name is Summer Dupree. I am of the Plants-by-the-Waters band of Lakota, and I'm from the Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota._

#### Educational Background

I'm a fourth-year student at Oglala Lakota College (OLC) working toward a B.S. in Natural Science with an emphasis in Conservation Biology. I also work as a research assistant with OLC building a habitat suitability model for a culturally significant plant on the Cheyenne River Reservation. This is my third year participating in the ESIIL Stars Internship and my second year as an Advanced Intern (A.I.).

#### Interests in Earth Data Science (EDS)
I'm interested in learning more about how to utilize publicly available remote sensing data to assess the types of vegetation present on my homelands.
